This is a small project investigating whether in heterosexual couples, the male partner is more often taller than the female partner than one would expect if height in matching was random. In other words, is there a bias in heterosexual couples for the pairing taller male/smaller female.

All data and methods are documented in the Rmd file ("r-heteroPairsHeight.Rmd"). Improvements and suggestions are welcome, ranging from more data to other/better ways to analyse the data.
